## 🏗️ Architecture

This is a full-stack application with a clear separation between frontend and backend:

```

├── frontend/          # React + TypeScript + Vite
├── backend/           # Django + PostgreSQL + REST API
├── README.md         # This file
└── requirements.txt  # Python dependencies
```

### Technology Stack

**Frontend**

- **React 19** with TypeScript for type-safe UI development

- **React Router** for client-side navigation

**Backend**

- **Django 4.2** with Django REST Framework
- **PostgreSQL** for robust data persistence
- **Clerk JWT Integration** for secure authentication
- **Machine Learning**: Sentence transformers for similarity scoring
- **CORS** configured for seamless frontend-backend communication

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** 18+ and npm
- **Python** 3.9+
- **PostgreSQL** 12+

## 🎯 Game Mechanics

### Acronym Puzzle System

Players are given a clue (e.g., "How players describe this game") and must guess words that form the specified acronym. Each letter of the acronym corresponds to one word that fits the clue.

**Example:**

- Clue: "How players describe this game"
- Acronym: GOAT
- Possible Solution: **Greatest Of All Time**

### Scoring and Progress

- **Level Up Mode**: Track progress through structured levels with par scores
- **Endless Mode**: Build streaks and compete for high scores
- **Daily Puzzles**: Complete daily challenges for consistent engagement
- **Progress Tracking**: Comprehensive user analytics and achievement system

## 🔧 Development
